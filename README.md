# Task Manager

This is a simple Python script that allows you to manage your daily tasks. You can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script (`main.py`) is located.

2. Run the script using the command: 

```sh
python main.py
```

3. The script will display a menu with the following options:
- **Add Task:** Add a new task to your task list.
- **View Tasks:** View your current list of tasks.
- **Mark Task as Completed:** Mark a task as completed by providing its task number.
- **Quit:** Exit the task manager.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the task manager.

5. Tasks and their completion status are saved in a file named `tasks.txt`.

## Notes

- Each task is assigned a task number for easy identification.
- The script reads and writes tasks to a file named `tasks.txt` in the same directory as the script.
- To mark a task as completed, provide its task number as shown in the list of tasks.
- You can modify the script to add additional features or customize the behavior to suit your needs.
